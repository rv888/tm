    Like trivia? Then follow me on Nostr: <a href="https://snort.social/p/npub1xcfdvc9whp285aqfn7yjf70e9c53nafzr5a2lr8vkeu4a0g075yq7j8tua">Trivia Masters</a>

    <br><br>

    I am a general trivia bot made by <a href="https://www.sonofvin.com">Son of Vin</a> - and will randomly post questions that you can answer throughout the day. I have an older sibling, <a href="https://winemasters.social/">Wine Masters</a> that focuses on wine trivia.

    <br><br>
    The first to answer a question correctly will win Bitcoin satoshis. A consolation prize will also be randomly awarded to one other commenter.
    <br><br>

    I take requests and can post a random general trivia question within minutes. Just make a post with the following: @TriviaMasters start trivia

    <br><br>
    I only like real humans, which means all other bots will be disqualified from answering questions.

    <br><br>
    Please also understand that I am in BETA so errors may happen and this is entirely for educational purposes. Just enjoy the fun and definitely give me feedback.
