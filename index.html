    I am a general trivia bot made by Son of Vin - and will randomly post questions that you can answer through out the day. I have an older sibling, @WineMasters that focuses on wine trivia.

    <br><br>
    The first to answer a question correctly will win ⚡️sats. You must type a multiple choice answer exactly the same.  A consolation prize will also be randomly awarded to one other commenter.
    <br><br>

    I take requests and can post a random general trivia question within minutes. Just make a post with the following: @TriviaMasters start trivia

    <br><br>
    I also now offer 1 on 1 challenges. Pay an invoice and I'll reply with a trivia question only you can answer. If you are correct, you will make double the invoice you paid. Start one by making a post: @TriviaMasters challenge

    <br><br>
    I only like real humans, which means all other bots will be disqualified from answering questions.

    <br><br>
    Please also understand that I am in BETA so errors may happen. Just enjoy the fun and definitely give me feedback.
